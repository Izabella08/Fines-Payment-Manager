The other component is used by the police employees to do the following operations: 
  (1) add/update/delete the driversâ€™ information (name, address, driving license details, identity card details), 
  (2) add/update/delete fines, 
  (3) create reports.  --using Factory DP

The last component is used by the driver to add a complaint. A police employee can also update/delete complaints.
